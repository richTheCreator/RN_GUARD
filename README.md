### Motivation :bulb:

RNG is intended to be a source of inspiration for building your own react-native application. A backpack full of commonly used design patterns, components, interactions, and more. 

> Defend your app, take your shield!🛡

### ⚔️ Tools 
Built for the modern RN developer.

###  :art: Simple Theming
> "Update once, update everywhere."
Start a consistent design system from the start. 

#### How To
Create or copy a folder that includes: <br/>

📄 Index.js <br/>
📄 Styles.js <br/>
📄 Component.js <br/>

In `Styles.js` place `import { Colors, Fonts } from '@theme/'`

In `Component.js` place `import Styles from './Styles'`

### 🛡 Secure Routing 
The router is protected with a combination of the `fb-sdk`, `mobx`, `mobx-persist`, and `react-native-router-flux`. 

#### RP_Server: <br/>
In order for this to work, you need to also download and install the [RP_Server](https://github.com/richTheCreator/RNG-SERVER). 

#### Custom Server: <br/>
Change these few files and functions: 

1. Open `userStore.js` 
2. Replace `signIn`, `signUp`, `createUser`, and `fetchUser`
3. Update `api.js` with your server address

#### :arrow_down: Install

### Step 1: Install React-Native

Make sure you're set up for [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content)

### Step 2: Node Version
Make sure you have Node 6.5+ <br/>

You can check your version of node by running

```
node -v
```

### Step 3: Install Yarn

Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for your system

### Step 4: Server Setup

Head over to the [repo ](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content) and follow the install instructions.

or provide your own server :smile:

### Step 5: Install the FBsdk
Make sure you have followed all the steps in the [React-Native-Fbsdk](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-fbsdk)
 
 A couple of tips!
 1. Make sure you have the `FacebookSDK` folder in `~/Documents`
 2. Check xCode `Build Settings` --> `Framework Search Paths` for a path to step 1.
 3. If no path, drag your `FacebookSDK` folder from `~/Documents` in
 4. Check your `info.plist` for proper credentials
 5. Open an issue if all else fails
